# Hangman.c

This C program was created to help me learn C. It's a simple Hangman game that randomly selects a word from a given array and tracks the number of attempts made.

## Installation

Clone the repository and compile the game using GCC:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
gcc game.c -o game   # compile the game and output as 'game'
```

## Usage

After compilation, run the game in your terminal:

```bash
./game
```

Make a guess and try to figure out the hidden word before you run out of attempts
